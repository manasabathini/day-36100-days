- Make sure you include `.` and `()` in your string manipulations.
- Strip the spaces first.
- The string manipulation needs to match the string. Ex: `.lower` = lowercase string
- Are your logical operators correct for the `if` statement?

```python
whatToEat = input("What do you fancy for dinner? ")
if whatToEat.strip().lower() == "pasta": 
  print("Get out the pasta maker.")
elif whatToEat.strip().lower() == "tacos":
  print("Let's do Taco Tuesday!")
else: 
  print("Go search the fridge.")
  ```
